                <div id="one">
                    Enlistment cannot be completed without confirmation. If you do not confirm, your slots will not be registered and you will not be officially enrolled in the classes you chose. To avoid losing your slots, and losing the classes you want, click the confirm button after choosing your classes. You may print your assessment form afterwards.

                <div id="two">
                    Students that require special assistance are to go to the venue for SOSE Enlistment. Non-degree students, as well as those returning from LOA, may go to the SOSE Enlistment venue during manual registration to enlist.

                <a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('three');"><button>I went to print my assessment form in the accounting office.</button></a>
                <div id="three">
                    Printing  of  assessment  forms  are  not  done  in  the  Accounting  Office. You should go to the enlistment venues, instead. You may print your assessment form during assigned manual registration in the designated venue assigned to your school. Make sure that you have already completed the enlistment process and only require the printed version of the assessment form. People who only need to print their assessment form do not need to follow the batching schedule.

                <div id="four">
                    Students  who  are  part  of  the  varsity  of  any  sport  are  entitled  to  a  special  Physical  Education  subject wherein only varsity players can enter and enlist in (PE261, PE262, PE263, and PE264). Only the regular PE subjects are available to those who are not part of any varsity team and they should get that PE. If it turns out that they were not able to enlist in a regular PE and mistakenly enlisted in a varsity class PE, then the problem can be fixed during the start of manual enlistment.

                    The  batching  system  during  the  manual  registration  period  is  different  from  that  of  the  online  enlistment process. To  avoid  confusion,  please  check  your <a href="batch.html">batch  number  and the  corresponding  batch  schedule  for manual registration</a>.

                <div id="six">
                    Subjects  such  as  English  and  Literature,  and  Science  subjects  with  both  Lecture  and  Laboratory,  are considered  paired  subjects.  Students  are  required  to  be  a  part  of  only  one  section for  paired  subjects  so they must make sure that they do not enlist in different sections.

                <div id="seven">
                    For  freshmen  and  sophomores,  NSTP,  PE  and  INTAC  are  non-academic  courses  and  as  such,  they  are not included in the academic load. Even if you enlist for these classes, you will not be overloaded and you will be able to complete the enlistment process. On the other hand, juniors, seniors, and superseniors who still have to enlist in NSTP, PE, or INTAC will have these courses added to their academic load.

                    Load revision forms can be obtained during the manual registration period, upon presentation of the tuition receipt or acknowledgment receipt. However, the processing of these load revision forms can only be done once classes for the semester have begun.<br>
